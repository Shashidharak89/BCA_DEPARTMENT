                        ಅನ್ನದಾನಾತ್ ಪರಂ ದಾನಮ್, ವಿದ್ಯಾ ದಾನ ಮತಃ ಪರಂ । ಅನ್ನೇನ ಕ್ಷಣಿಕಾ ತೃಪ್ತಿ:, ಯಾವಜ್ಜೀವಂ ಚ ವಿದ್ಯಯಾ ।। :so
                        goes a subhashita. Handing out food to the needy is considered a noble act of kindness, but
                        providing education is nobler than that. Food will have a feel-good factor only temporarily. The
                        satisfaction derived from education endures unto the last. Education is a primordial element in
                        evolving a civilisation and a bulwark of empowerment. Considering the importance of education,
                        individuals and institutions dedicated to serve the humankind, have strained every sinew to set
                        up educational facilities that have proven positive ramifications in the nook and cranny of the
                        nation. Apart from bridging the urban-rural divide, these facilities have helped the
                        underprivileged sections to muster strength to stand up and get noticed. In the forefront of
                        this noble mission, the CBE, Mangalore enjoys a distinct place. An array of learning centers
                        established from time to time as per the need of the hour are a testimony to the service
                        rendered to the society by the Missionaries. Sacred Heart College is one of the distinguished
                        institutions managed by the CBE. Over the years the college has gone from one strength to
                        another. Only stars have meteoric rise. Institutions rise in phases. The pulls and pressures of
                        deficiencies bog down a young institution, but the undesirable situation is short lived.
                        Interventional measures serve as pick- me- up. The unheralded rural setting has been a
                        formidable challenge. The rustic young talent is restless to express itself here. A pragmatic
                        approach of the Management has mitigated the hardships. In the last 15 – 20 years consolidation
                        process has been constantly on. The results are tangible. Our students albeit their rustic
                        background have risen to the occasion when it mattered the most and stood tall in the area of
                        action – be it academic or cultural or sports and games. A big tally of medals earned by our
                        students in the last couple of years is an unfailing testimony to the institutional efforts
                        towards quality enhancement and accomplishment, fortitude and focus of the students as well as
                        the intense will of all the Sacred Heart members to conquer. In the years that I have been
                        assigned the leadership role at our esteemed institution, I have reasons to feel overwhelmed by
                        the achievements of the College. Our talented young sports stars have displayed their mettle in
                        the sporting arena in areas as diverse as Kabaddi, Football, Ball- badminton in both men and
                        women sections at the University and State open Tournaments and returned with rich exploits. The
                        icing on the cake is the dominant performance in the Football tournament. The acid test awaited
                        the Institution this academic year, which incidentally happens to be the last year of my
                        teaching and administrative career. The entire year was a beehive of activities as the college
                        was in preparation mode for Reaccreditation by the NAAC. Every member of the Sacred Heart family
                        contributed their lot to land the coveted top grade.

                        'Together we can' were the buzz words and going an extra mile was the creed. Our sincere and
                        focused efforts returned rich rewards. We retained the top grade 'A' in the Fourth cycle of NAAC
                        accreditation. Not a mean achievement for a rural college!!!. The up ticking graph of academic
                        facilities has been further bolstered by adding another batch to the BCA Programme. The roof top
                        of the majestic indoor stadium has been given a facelift with additional safety features so as
                        to make it withstand the vagaries of natural uncertainties. The efforts to make the campus a
                        Centre for excellence are relentlessly on. The coming years hold much more to Sacred Heart
                        College. May the legacy of dream, work and achieve continue forever. I am greatly indebted to
                        the Management, thankful to the well wishers, grateful to my loving companions and happy for
                        my dear students.
